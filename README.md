Frank's Laboratory's Planet Defense Tutorial
Every game is made out of a few basic building blocks. Once you understand these techniques you can get creative, combine these elements in different ways and make many different games easily. 
Let's learn JavaScript by making games. 

Today we are building an animated 2d game completely from scratch with no frameworks and no libraries using just plain vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 canvas. 

Discover many 2D game development techniques and learn how to implement them with JavaScript. We will cover everything from keyboard and mouse controls to performance friendly sprite animation tips and tricks, and the main focus this time is object pool design pattern. We will use it for enemies and for player projectiles, because reusing our objects, rather then creating and discarding them over and over, can be a massive performance benefit.

This class is for creative coders who want to learn about the fundamentals of 2D game development as well as for JavaScript beginners who want to practice their object oriented programming skills on a fun visual and interactive project.
